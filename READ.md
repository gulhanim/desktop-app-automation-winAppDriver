Windows 10: I use Windows 10 x64. You might be running a 32-bit version of Windows, but the only difference might be the location of some components. 

Test Application: For our tests, we will be using a default "Notepad" app available on any Windows computer. 

Location: C:\Windows\System32\notepad.exe

Windows Application Driver: The main component that we need for Windows Automation

Windows 10 SDK: To be able to inspect elements inside the application. We will use the “inspect.exe” tool for that purpose

IntelliJ IDEA: IDE that we will use for writing our tests

Java JDK: Since we are writing our tests in Java we would need this component for our tests to function.
 
Note: Java JDK could be installed automatically by using the IntelliJ IDEA.
